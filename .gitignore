# Source Repo (if we want to exclude the original reference repo, usually yes if we merged assets)
# source_repo/ 
# actually, keeping source_repo might be useful for history, but if it has its own .git it's a submodule or nested repo. 
# safely, let's ignore the nested .git inside it or just ignore the folder if not needed.
# Since we copied assets, we might not need it, but let's keep it tracked if the user wants "everything". 
# However, nested git repos are tricky. I will assume we track it as a folder, but git will likely complain about the nested .git.
# I'll let git handle the nested repo warning or submodule suggestion, but for now just standard ignores.
